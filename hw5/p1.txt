Kosaraju outputs linked list of SCC's

Assume edge E has two parameters,
E.source - source vertex
E.dest - destination vertex

getNCEdges(Graph(V,E))
Run Kosaraju, store results in SCC list
for every edge E
{
  create empty array of edges
  if E.dest belongs to SCC with size > 1
    if E.source belongs to same SCC
      This edge is component
  else non-comp, add it to return edge array
  return edge array
}

O(E * # of SCCs)
 
worst case scenario would be # of SCC's = # of Vertexes
so O(E*V) for algo, Kosujara is O(E+V) so whichever is bigger is total
E*V should be bigger, total: O(E*V) 

How good is that? Not great, if we assume V = E then this would be O(E^2)
Is there a better way?
