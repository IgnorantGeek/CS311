Assume Dijkstra returns a list of verticies, with a variable that stores the distance from the source to each vertex

int getRelTime(Graph G, vertex A, vertex B)
{
  A2B = Dijkstra(G, A); //gets list of distances from A to all reachable vertices
  B2A = Dijkstra(G, B); //gets list of distances from B to all reachable vertices
  Atime = null;
  Btime = null;
  for all vertices V in A2B
    if V == B
      Atime = V.dist;
  for all vertices V in B2A
    if V == A
      Btime = V.dist;
  if (!Atime)
  {
    //A is not eventual follower of B
    return null;
  }
  if (!Btime)
  {
    //B is not eventual follower of A, but A is eventual of B
    return Atime;
  }
  //if we get here, Atime and Btime are not null, thus A and B are eq
  else return 0;
}
